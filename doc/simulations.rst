Running simulations
====================

The :code:`simulators` module provides solvers for the neuronal activity.

Given a previously simulated mesh in :code:`mesh_folder`, the user can set some parameters of the simulator and run the
simulation in a few lines.

To run a simulation with default parameters, one can simply run:


.. code-block:: python

    _ = neuronmi.simulate_emi(mesh_folder)
